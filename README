Run ./app without args for help;

Write your code in fcompression.cpp;

Some functions, that could be useful for your project (look bmplib.h for details):
  [*] Image  *load_image        (const char *filename);              
  [*] bool    save_image        (const char *filename, Image *image);
  [*] bool    draw_solid_image  (const char *filename, uint32_t height, uint32_t width, 
                                 uint8_t color[3]);
                                 
                                      ColorSpace may be RGB or YUV
  [*] ImageMatrix  *get_image_matrix  (Image *base_image, ColorSpace colorspace); 
  
  
  !!! Load the image, then use ImageMatrix and work with matrix, not with the image! !!!
  !!! After call of ImageMatrix, you don't need to save the Image object, ImageMatrix contains pixel per each channel. !!!
  
  
Don't forget to delete all resources after all:
  [*] void delete_image        (Image *image);
  [*] void delete_image_matrix (ImageMatrix *matrix);
